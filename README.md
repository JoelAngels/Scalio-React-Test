## Description

Before you judge my code, CTO(Micah Lucas) and PWE(Mike lgnatev), PM (Nikita Ivanov) I wanted to say that I really did my best with the coding question, It wasn't easy as it pushed me to learn something new, but regardless thank you for checking out my code, this was a learning process and I believe at the job its a learning process as well. I really like what the company is initiating and how it solves problems. Apart from that, I Built this Scalio React App that uses the API endpoint that was given to me. I built my own custom search engine that displayed the results oF the login info to the Table. This Project also used the Official Google Design Library, Material UI for the Table UI.

The Api endpoint, I found one that supported pagination but I tried finding a way on how I could connect it to material ui Table, but It wasn't that successful, 
What I would have done better was to allow the api endpoint to try and get the data sorted. It was a wonderful experience regardless.

## Description

Before you judge my code, CTO(Micah Lucas) and PWE(Mike lgnatev) I wanted to say that I really did my best with the coding question, It wasn't easy as it pushed me to learn something new, but regardless thank you for checking out my code, this was a learning process and I believe at the job its a learning process as well. I really like what the company is initiating and how it solves problems. Apart from that, I Built this Scalio React App that uses the API endpoint that was given to me. I built my own custom search engine that displayed the results oF the login info to the Table. This Project also used the Official Google Design Library, Material UI for the Table UI.
